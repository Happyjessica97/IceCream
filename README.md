# IceCreamWorld
Description of game: 
A scoop of ice cream (the player) is trying to get to its cone, however, there are obstacles along the way.  Sun ninjas and fireballs are your enemies! Using the left and right arrow keys allows the scoop of ice cream to avoid being melted. 

Mission Bit Intern at Hack Reactor. 
In three weeks I built this JavaScript Project.  I used the Canvas API to create the animations,graphics, and to render it.
